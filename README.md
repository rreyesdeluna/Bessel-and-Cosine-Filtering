This work uses a novel filtering strategy based on scaled Bessel and cosine functions to extract modal parameters of electromechanical oscillations in power systems.
These strategies aim to extract single-component signals from a multi-component signal.
In this research, the first-order Bessel functions are utilized with a scaling that allows the generation of an optimal filter for extracting low-frequency
single-component signals, which are crucial in power systems. 
Additionally, these filters, are designed optimally for extracting low-frequency mono-components, demonstrating high
stability in results. Another advantage of these filter banks is that
they do not require special adaptations for specific frequencies
in each signal.

Both filter banks were designed to minimize frequencies not present in the signal as much as possible and to excite
functions with similar frequencies, with the capability to avoid noise contamination and undesired frequencies.
